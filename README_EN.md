## 📖 ABOUT THE PROJECT

**VEIN Server Management Toolkit** is a comprehensive solution for managing VEIN (Unreal Engine 5.4) dedicated game servers.

### 🎯 Why is it needed?

Managing a game server isn't just "running a file". It's about:

- 🔄 **Automation** - scheduled restarts, monitoring, backups
- 📊 **Monitoring** - performance tracking, online players, statistics
- 🛠️ **Diagnostics** - identifying issues, log analysis, optimization
- 💾 **Security** - data protection, automatic backups, recovery
- 🎭 **Convenience** - everything in one window, clear interface, routine automation

### ⭐ What makes the project special?

```
✅ Solves REAL problems (based on production server experience)
✅ Professional approach (automation, protection, monitoring)
✅ Continuous development (from basic to Ultimate Edition)
✅ Open source (MIT License)
✅ Detailed documentation (every feature documented)
```
