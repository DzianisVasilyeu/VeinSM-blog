# 🚀 Stage 1: How It All Started

**Date:** November 2025  
**Topic:** Beginning of VEIN Server Management project

## 🎯 The Problem

Imagine: you have a VEIN game server. You want to:
- Start and stop it
- See what's happening (logs)
- Do automatic restarts
- Not sit at the computer 24/7

**But how?** 🤔

Standard way:
1. Open command prompt
2. Navigate to server folder
3. Run .exe file
4. Watch console
5. Ctrl+C to stop
6. Repeat for every restart

**This is inconvenient!** Especially if you need to restart every 3-4 hours.

## 💡 The Idea

Create a **simple manager** with buttons:
- ▶️ START
- ⏹️ STOP
- 🔄 RESTART
- 📋 Logs in window

Simple, but effective!

## 🛠️ Development

First version - **Basic Manager**:
- Graphical interface (GUI)
- 3 control buttons
- Log window
- Automatic restart by interval

**Development time:** 1 day  
**Result:** It works! Server can be managed without command line

## 🎉 First Results

```
✅ No more command line needed
✅ All logs visible in one window
✅ Can set up automatic restarts
✅ Simple and clear interface
```

## 🤔 But New Questions Appeared...

After using Basic Manager for several days, players started asking:

- "Why do monitoring sites show 0 online when we're playing?"
- "Can we do restarts at specific times, not every 3 hours?"
- "How to get player statistics?"

**Solution:** Need a more advanced version!

## 🔜 What's Next?

Work begins on **Advanced Manager**:
- Fake Online proxy (for monitoring sites)
- Scheduled restarts by time
- Improved interface

**Stage 1 completed:** Basic Manager works and is being used! ✅
